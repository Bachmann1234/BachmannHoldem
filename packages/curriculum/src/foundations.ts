/**
 * The **Foundations primer** — the lessons that teach the six concepts the coach assumes (tickets
 * 0042 / 0045 / 0071).
 *
 * This module is *content*, not engine: it is the declarative layer of the learning approach
 * ([../../../docs/LEARNING-APPROACH.md]). The coach narrates a live spot in terms of six mental
 * models — equity, pot odds, the continue rule (equity-vs-price), EV, position, and ranges — and
 * *assumes the player already holds them*. The primer is where the player gets them, taught the way
 * the evidence says they stick: **by retrieval, not by re-reading** (DeDonno 2008). So every lesson
 * is a ~30-second plain-language teach followed by a {@link Spot} the player must *answer* — the
 * retrieval check is the lesson; the prose is just the setup.
 *
 * **Scope discipline (the epic's rule): a primer, not a course.** Still **six concepts** — but seven
 * lessons, because the v2 facing-a-raise lesson (ticket 0071) reuses the `ranges` concept rather than
 * extending the union. Each lesson earns its ~30 seconds; we add a lesson only when a concept has a
 * second, distinct must-teach angle (open-or-fold vs. facing-a-raise), never to pad. Depth lives in
 * the feedback loop — the live coach, the M5 drills, M6 — not in more reading here. We resisted
 * padding this into a textbook.
 *
 * **Coach-true by construction (the cardinal rule).** Wherever the deterministic coach *can* rule, a
 * lesson's spot is graded by the coach, never by a hand-authored answer key — so a future coach
 * retune can never silently desync the primer from the table. The continue-decision concepts
 * (equity, pot odds, equity-vs-price, EV) are {@link CoachSpot}s graded by `coachDecision`; the
 * range/position concepts are {@link PreflopSpot}s graded by `gradePreflop`'s chart. There is **no**
 * {@link DeclarativeSpot} carve-out in this primer: every concept the ticket needs maps onto a coach
 * or chart ruling, including position (see the position lesson note). The coach's equity is a seeded
 * Monte-Carlo read against `COACH_ASSUMED_RANGE`, so each spot's cards/price were *tuned* until the
 * coach returns the verdict the lesson teaches, and `foundations.test.ts` *proves* that verdict for
 * every spot — the test is the guard against desync.
 *
 * **A note on the `concept` tags.** A live continue-verdict rolls pot-odds and EV into the single
 * `'equity-vs-price'` tag (and a free check into `'equity'`) — that is the coach's mapping and we do
 * not fight it. The thing that names *what a lesson teaches* is the {@link Lesson.concept} field,
 * authored here; the underlying coach verdict on each spot may carry a broader tag, which is fine and
 * expected (the test asserts both: the lesson's declared concept, and the spot's coach verdict tag).
 *
 * Purity: pure data + plain strings, no UI/DOM/Node/network, no JSX. Imports only `@holdem/*` and
 * relative. The lesson copy is plain markdown-ish text so it stays framework-agnostic for both shells.

// `gradePreflop` sees `currentBet > bigBlind` and takes its defend path (`trace.facingRaise === true`).

//   - A speculative hand (76s, the `playable` tier) in early position — out of position — facing a LARGE 6 BB raise.

// The correctness keystone of the v2 primer (ticket 0074) and the durable fix for BUG-0010: the

// draw is routinely a profitable continue at a price a bit *worse* than its immediate equity. A
// beginner who took the rule literally would fold profitable draws, which is the very bug this lesson
// closes (the continue-rule lesson now forward-points here, strengthened above).
//
// The lesson teaches at the seam of what the coach can and cannot rule, with TWO spots on the *same*
// draw (a bare flush draw, Th9h on Ah-7h-2c) at two different prices — so the learner sees the same
// hand flip from a coach-blessable call to an implied-odds-only call:
//
//   - A COACH-GRADED CoachSpot where the coach CAN rule: the flush draw faces a small ~1/4-pot bet
//     (call 25 into a 100 pot, price 20%). The coach's seeded equity read against its assumed range is
//     ~37%, comfortably above the 20% price, so coachDecision blesses the call (callEv ≈ +21,

//     43% price — so coachDecision would call this a LEAK (callEv ≈ −6, verdict 'leak'). The coach
//     models ONLY current equity; it does not model the future bets a flush wins when it completes on
//     the turn or river. With those implied odds the call is profitable, so the correct answer is to
//     call — which the coach cannot rule, hence a DeclarativeSpot. The explanation is scrupulously
//     honest: it states plainly that *by the immediate continue rule (what the coach measures) this
//     looks like a fold*, and that the draw's future winnings flip it to a call — and it states the
//     limits (you need deep enough stacks to win those bets; clean outs to the best hand, or reverse
//     implied odds can cost you when you make a second-best hand). This is the documented purpose of
//     the declarative carve-out: teaching the LIMIT of the immediate-equity lens, never contradicting

//
// Closes the 0042/0045 "board texture" scope gap (ticket 0073). The teaching point: the SAME hand is
// strong or weak depending on what the board makes possible — so reading texture is the input to nearly
// every postflop call. This is the epic's *preferred* design — fully COACH-GRADED, no declarative
// carve-out — because the board-aware range (ticket 0057) makes texture gradable directly: on a barreled
// line the coach reads against a texture-conditioned *polarized* range (the value combos the board
// supports + a bluff fraction), so the SAME hand facing the SAME large bet gets a DIFFERENT verdict on a
// dry vs a wet board, purely because the board-supported value differs. That is the coach-true texture
// demonstration the ticket asks for; no answer key is authored.
//
// Two CoachSpots, the SAME bluff-catcher (Q♣Q♦, a pair below an ace) facing the SAME large barrel
// (pot 120, call 80 — a ~2×-pot overbet, price 40%), on two boards, so the verdict flips by texture
// ALONE. Both read as a `barreled` line (the bet is ≥ LARGE_BET_POT_FRACTION of the pot it faced), so on
// both the coach swaps in the polarized board-aware range (`trace.assumedRange === 'board-aware'`) —
// proven in the test, so we know the texture path actually fired.
//
//   - DRY  A♠7♦2♣ rainbow (no flush, no straight, an ace overhead): QQ is an UNDERPAIR to the ace.
//     The board supports few value combos (150) — but they are dominated by all the top-pair ACES that
//     beat QQ. The coach reads QQ at only ~26%, well below the 40% price, so the call is a −EV LEAK and
//     folding is correct. (eq 0.257 < thr 0.40, callEv ≈ −29.)
//   - WET  9♥8♥7♣ two-tone (straights and a flush draw live, all low cards): QQ is now an OVERPAIR — it
//     beats every top pair (a pair of 9/8/7) the board makes and loses only to the sets/straights/
//     two-pairs. The coach reads QQ at ~52%, just above the 40% price, so the call is +EV and correct
//     — but a close one, not comfortable; folding is the leak. (eq 0.523 > thr 0.40, callEv ≈ +25.)
//
// Same QQ, same overbet — the board alone flips the verdict. Tuned + proven in foundations.test.ts
// (dry: call leak / fold good; wet: call good / fold leak; both `trace.assumedRange === 'board-aware'`).
// concept 'equity-vs-price' (the locked reuse — ticket 0070; a barreled postflop CoachSpot carries that
